Anna Kelbert joined the ADS/SciX in 2024 as the project scientist for Earth science.

After obtaining her B.A. in Mathematics from Cambridge University, UK in 2002 and a Ph.D. in Geophysics from Cardiff University, UK in 2006, Dr. Kelbert found her professional home at the Oregon State University first as a postdoctoral researcher, research associate, and eventually as an Assistant Professor (Senior Research) in 2014, specializing in global electromagnetics, magnetotellurics and cyberinfrastructure for the geosciences.  In 2015, Dr. Kelbert joined the U.S. Geological Survey's Geomagnetism Program in Golden, CO to work on space weather hazards. During her tenure at USGS she served on the Leadership Council of the NSF's EarthCube program and on the IAGA Executive Committee, and participated in the National Space Weather Operations, Research and Mitigation (SWORM) government task force. At ADS/SciX, Dr. Kelbert is working to make the Science Explorer relevant and reliable for all areas of Earth science research.
